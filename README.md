# AES RTL Verification using UVM
This repository contains the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbench created to verify an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) RTL implementation written in Verilog. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete verification environment that ensures the AES module functions according to the design specifications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The RTL design files for the AES module are sourced externally and are not created by me, done by [Eng. Michael ehab](https://github.com/michaelehab). This repository focuses only on the verification environment using UVM.

## Introduction
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm. This project provides a UVM-based verification environment for testing an externally provided RTL implementation of the AES algorithm. The environment is designed to thoroughly verify the AES module's functionality, including both encryption and decryption processes.
